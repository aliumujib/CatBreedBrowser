# CatBreedBrowser

This repository contains a Cat Breed Library application that is implemented MVI architecture using
Dagger, Jetpack Compose, Navigation Compose, MVI.

## ‚ú®Features

This application has the following features:

- Display cat image and breed, descriptions.
- Display cat breed details
- Save and display favourites in a list

## üè¢Architecture

This application leverages the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture, Clean Onion layered architecture, and the Repository Pattern to ensure a robust and scalable design.

### MVI Implementation

The MVI architecture is implemented using two key components:

1. **IntentProcessor**:
    - This class accepts intents and transforms them into results by invoking use cases, which in turn call repository functions.
    - The results are modeled as sealed classes to represent the output of various operations.

2. **StateReducer**:
    - This component takes the previous state (or initial state) and a result, transforming them into a new state that can be rendered in the UI.

### Dependency Injection

Both the IntentProcessor and StateReducer are injected into the ViewModel. The ViewModel connects these components through a delegate, ensuring unidirectional data flow and clear state transitions without tight coupling between components.

### Benefits

- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: The architecture enforces unidirectional data flow, simplifying state management and ensuring predictable state transitions.
- **Testability**: The separation of concerns and modular design allow individual components and state transitions to be easily tested.
- **Scalability and Maintainability**: By adhering to Clean Onion architecture and the Repository Pattern, the application remains scalable and maintainable, with clear boundaries and responsibilities for each layer.

This approach ensures a maintainable codebase with a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to extend and test the application.

## üì¶Module
The application is organized to group modules based on features, ensuring related features are contained within the same folder/module. This structure maintains clarity and separation of concerns within the codebase.

### Feature-Based Module Organization

- **Feature Modules**:
    - Each feature module contains its own domain and data layers, encapsulating all necessary components for the feature.
    - This modularization ensures that each feature operates independently, promoting maintainability and scalability.

### Shared Modules

The application also includes shared modules to handle common functionalities and configurations. These shared modules include:

- **Local Room Database**: Centralized setup and configuration for the Room database used across various features.
- **Test Utilities**: Common utilities and configurations for testing, facilitating consistent and efficient test setups.
- **Networking**: Shared networking setup and configurations, ensuring a unified approach to network operations.
- **Design System**: Common design elements and styles, promoting consistency in the application's user interface.
